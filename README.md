# Weather-Tracker

A really simple weather tracking website with python and flask that allows users to search for a city and see the weather in real time using the OpenWeatherMap API!

I created this project to practice backend web development and using API's

## Features!

- Search for weather by the city name
- Displays:
    - Current temperature in Celsius
    - Weather Description such as cloudy or sunny
- Real time data from openweathermap!
- Tried making a clean UI with CSS.
- API key securely stored.

## Future Improvements

- Add a button that turns the degrees from celsius to fahrenheit
- Display some more weather data for example the humidity or UV or windspeed.
- Add search history that stores past 5 cities entered (this somewhat works so far)
